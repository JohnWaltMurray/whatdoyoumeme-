Hello, my name is John Murray. I am a undergraduate student taking this
class to fulfil elective requirements to finish my degree in Computer
Science. To date, I've taken many Computer related courses, and I am 
most familiar with programming in Java, however I have done HTML, 
Javascript, and CSS in the past and have been using the 
w3schools guides to brush back up on my skills with them. I've worked 
on many different small projects using mostly Eclipse, ranging from
programming small utilities to top down Shmups (Shoot 'em ups). Because 
of this, Eclipse is the compiler and GUI I am most familiar with, though it shouldn't be too hard to get used to other platforms like Visual Studio Code.

Other than that, I enjoy playing Strategy games, board games, playing the piano, and reading.
