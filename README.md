Hello, my name is John Murray. I am a undergraduate student taking this
class to fulfil elective requirements to finish my degree in Computer
Science. To date, I've taken many Computer related courses, and I am 
most familiar with programming in Java, however I have done HTML, 
Javascript, and CSS in the past and have been using the 
w3schools guides to brush back up on my skills with them.

# I can definitely see myself making use of the skills taught in this class.
# As of yet it has been among the most practical classes I've taken so far,
# since using Git hasn't been touched upon too much in many of the other 
# classes I've taken, even though it is essentially an industry standard.
# Knowledge of web programming can always be useful, even if you're working o
# a project separate from web development having the skills to create
# websites and understand the techniques behind websites you browse is 
# useful for someone aspiring to work in Computer Science. Plus, if 
# you have any need of a website in the future, rather than relying on
# paying someone who knows about developing websites you can build them
# yourself.
